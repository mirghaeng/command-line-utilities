Application/Design
	TCP-based chat program composed of a client
	for the end users and a server program which
	will be used to connect clients so that they
	can exchange messages. The client should
	operate in three modes:
	INFO - asking server for information
	WAIT - waiting to be contacted by another
		client
	CHAT - exchanging messages with another
		client
	INFO mode support the following commands:
	/list - get client list
	/wait - insert client to client list and
		enter WAIT mode
	/connect <ID> - start conversation with
			<ID> and enter CHAT mode
	/quit - leave program

Shortcomings
	The program is very buggy
	Sending client ID from client side results in
	a fatal error
