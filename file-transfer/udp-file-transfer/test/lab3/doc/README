doc/DOCUMENTATION
	Documentation of internal design of reliable UDP file
	transfer.

src/myserver.c
	Server side that allows client to get file size and download
	file content in chunks using UDP.

src/myclient.c
	Client side that provides a list of server information, the
	number of server-port pairs, and filename to get the content
	of the requested file using UDP.

src/packet.h
	Helper side to help with packet topology.

NOTE:
	The code is incomplete. For reasons unknown to me, I was
	unable to open the requested file on the server side.
	And this made it difficult to proceed further in the lab
	since I was not able to test out the rest of the code.
	My code can read the server-info.text file, get file size,
	but is not able to get file content.
