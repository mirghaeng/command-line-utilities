myclient.c
	client download "chunks" of a file from
	multiple servers

myserver.c
	server follows client file transfer
	protocol instructions to give file size
	and allow downloading of "chunks"

README
	describes the files in lab2

NOTE:
My code does not work properly. I still need to
implement a mutex to allow server processes threads
to access a file to write the chunks into one at a
time, using pwrite(). I am currently stuck at writing
integer values from server to client and vice versa.
