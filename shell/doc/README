Documentation
	explains how to and design

NOTE:
	There is a bug in my code, thus I was not able to
	continue with much of the lab. On the client side,
	recv() does not stop reading even though I had
	restricted it to execute only if > 0 in a while loop

	I fixed the bug to an extent. Instead of putting
	recv() in a loop, I transmit the length information
	first, and subsequetly call recv() until length
	information has been reached. However, my
	implementation left some extra output, like
	MSG_STOPREADING

	For some reason, I can't run ./myserver 1234
	It gives me bind() error even though i had only
	tried to alter code regarding recv()
