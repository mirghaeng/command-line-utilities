HOW TO / DESIGN:
- run
	./myserver 1234
	./myclient 127.0.0.1 1234
	./myclient 127.0.0.1 1234
		  ...
	./myclient 127.0.0.1 123
- client is prompted to enter a command
afer "client $ "
	cat /etc/resolv.conf
	cat <filename>
	date
	df -h
	du
	echo $PATH
	echo <environment variable>
	free
	last
	ps aux
	pwd
	set
	tty
	uname -a
	uptime
	who
	exit
- if not, server receives the command
and sends the executable size to client
- client receives the executable
size and requests for the output
- server sends the output
- client prints output on stdout
- continue until client enters
