Lab1 - HTTP Requests on Client

Goal:
	Client can make HEAD and GET requests and
	receive HEAD response in stdout and
	receive GET response in output.dat.
	For HEAD request, client can enter:
	./myweb www.example.com 93.184.216.34:80/index.html -h
	For GET request, client can enter:
	./myweb www.example.com 93.184.216.34:80/index.html
	The specified port# is optional.	

Application and Design:
	We can tokenize the command arguments and set the
	hostname, pathname, ip, port#, and request type.
	Create socket, setup the address fields, and tcp
	connect to socket. Write and send the specified
	request. If the request type is HEAD, read and
	print the request to stdout until "\r\n\r\n".
	If the request type is GET, get header string and
	find Content-Length. Starting from the end of
	the header, read and print the response body to
	output.dat until the specified Content-Length
	is reached.

Potential Shortcomings:
	If the client wishes to send a GET request and 
	the corresponding HTTP response does not contain
	a Content-Length, then client program will not work.
