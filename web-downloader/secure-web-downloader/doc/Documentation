Application:

	The client side of a simple secure HTTP-based download application
	similar to wget. It uses the SSL library when the URL specifies the
	https:// scheme. To handle the hostname, the application determines
	the IP address using the DNS library.

	- Build the executable program
		make

	- Run the executable program

		- For GET functionality, run
			./myweb https://example.com:443/index.html

			- Read output.dat for requested info

		- For HEAD functionality, run
			./myweb https://example.com:443/index.html -h

			- Read stdout for request info

Design:

	- Set SSLmode to 0
	- Tokenize the arguments
	- If first token is not "https", set SSLmode to 1
	- Initialize socket, hostname, port, address
	- Connect socket
	- If SSLmode == 1, initialize SSL
	- Check if "-h" in arguments, then format request
	- Send request accordingly to SSLmode
	- If HEAD request, read response up to "\r\n\r\n"
		accordingly to SSLmode and print to stdout
	- If GET request, read response up to "\r\n\r\n"
		accordingly to SSLmode and store string
		- Find "Content-Length" and get its value
		- Print response up to a size of value
